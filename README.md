##Introduction
This application uses simple questions and an image based interface to introduce newcomers to financial technology. With each site visit, users are presented with questions that test their knowedge of their own financial habits. The user's answers are compared to their actual financial data, provided by the Level Money API, allowing them to track the accuracy of their knowledge over time. The results are presented visually through charts and graphics using the Plotly API.
